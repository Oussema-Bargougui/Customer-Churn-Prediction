# Customer-Churn-Prediction
 Customer Churn Prediction project aims to predict churn using machine learning. Using the CRISP-DM methodology, we analyzed telecom data, applied techniques like SMOTE , ENN, and built models such as XGBoost and Gradient Boosting, achieving high accuracy and insights to improve retention strategies.
